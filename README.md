# Group-Project-API

## Description

For our group project, we decided to make a dashboard for users to receive information from several different APIs in one location. Upon opening the page, users will be able to dynamically add cards to the page that display information such as weather data, news, sports scores, and fun facts. All updates made on the page will be saved to local storage for recall when reopening or refreshing the page.

Our group utilized a number of different APIs including:

    https://openweathermap.org/api

    https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes

    https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/riddles

    https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

    https://api.portkey.uk/quote

    https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/api/v2/facts/random

    https://api-sports.io/

    https://newsdata.io/
