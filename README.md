# Group-Project-API

## Description

For our group project, we decided to make a dashboard for users to receive information from several different APIs in one location. Upon opening the page, users will be able to dynamically add cards to the page that display information such as weather data, news, sports scores, and fun facts. The page layout will change depending on the number of cards on the screen.
